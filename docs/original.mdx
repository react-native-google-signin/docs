# Original Google sign in

This module exposes

- [Google Sign-In for Android (legacy)](https://web.archive.org/web/20240308064911/https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating). The underlying SDK is deprecated but functional.
- [Google Sign-In SDK](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start) for iOS and macOS (macOS support is only available to [sponsors](install#sponsor-only-version)).

```ts title="imports example"
import {
  GoogleSignin,
  GoogleSigninButton,
  statusCodes,
} from '@react-native-google-signin/google-signin';
```

### `configure`

signature: (`options`: [`ConfigureParams`](api#configureparams)) => `void`

It is mandatory to call this method before attempting to call `signIn()` and `signInSilently()`. This method is synchronous, meaning you can call `signIn` / `signInSilently` right after it. Typically, you would call `configure` only once, soon after your app starts. All parameters are optional.

Example usage with default options: you'll get user email and basic profile info.

```js
import { GoogleSignin } from '@react-native-google-signin/google-signin';

GoogleSignin.configure();
```

An example with all options enumerated:

```ts
GoogleSignin.configure({
  webClientId: '<FROM DEVELOPER CONSOLE>', // client ID of type WEB for your server. Required to get the `idToken` on the user object, and for offline access.
  scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly'], // what API you want to access on behalf of the user, default is email and profile
  offlineAccess: true, // if you want to access Google API on behalf of the user FROM YOUR SERVER
  hostedDomain: '', // specifies a hosted domain restriction
  forceCodeForRefreshToken: true, // [Android] related to `serverAuthCode`, read the docs link below *.
  accountName: '', // [Android] specifies an account name on the device that should be used
  iosClientId: '<FROM DEVELOPER CONSOLE>', // [iOS] if you want to specify the client ID of type iOS (otherwise, it is taken from GoogleService-Info.plist)
  googleServicePlistPath: '', // [iOS] if you renamed your GoogleService-Info file, new name here, e.g. "GoogleService-Info-Staging"
  openIdRealm: '', // [iOS] The OpenID2 realm of the home web server. This allows Google to include the user's OpenID Identifier in the OpenID Connect ID token.
  profileImageSize: 120, // [iOS] The desired height (and width) of the profile image. Defaults to 120px
});
```

### `signIn`

signature: (`options`: [`SignInParams`](api#signinparams)) => `Promise`\<[`SignInResponse`](api#signinresponse)\>

Prompts a modal to let the user sign in into your application. Resolved promise returns an [`SignInResponse` object](api#signinresponse). Rejects with an error otherwise.

```ts title="signIn example" showLineNumbers
// import statusCodes along with GoogleSignin
import {
  GoogleSignin,
  statusCodes,
} from '@react-native-google-signin/google-signin';

// Somewhere in your code
const signIn = async () => {
  try {
    await GoogleSignin.hasPlayServices();
    const { type, data } = await GoogleSignin.signIn();
    if (type === 'success') {
      setState({ userInfo: data });
    } else {
      // sign in was cancelled by user
    }
  } catch (error) {
    if (isErrorWithCode(error)) {
      switch (error.code) {
        case statusCodes.IN_PROGRESS:
          // operation (eg. sign in) already in progress
          break;
        case statusCodes.PLAY_SERVICES_NOT_AVAILABLE:
          // Android only, play services not available or outdated
          break;
        default:
        // some other error happened
      }
    } else {
      // an error that's not related to google sign in occurred
    }
  }
};
```

### `addScopes`

signature: (`options`: [`AddScopesParams`](api#addscopesparams)) => `Promise`\<[`SignInResponse`](api#signinresponse) \| `null`\>

This method resolves with `SignInResponse` object or with `null` if no user is currently logged in.

You may not need this call: you can supply required scopes to the `configure` call. However, if you want to gain access to more scopes later, use this call.

Example:

```js
const user = await GoogleSignin.addScopes({
  scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/user.gender.read'],
});
```

---

### `signInSilently`

signature: () => `Promise`\<[`SignInSilentlyResponse`](api#signinsilentlyresponse)\>

May be called e.g. after of your main component mounts. This method returns a `Promise` that resolves with the `SignInSilentlyResponse` object and rejects with an error otherwise.

To see how to handle errors read [`signIn()` method](#signin)

```ts
const getCurrentUser = async () => {
  try {
    const { type, data } = await GoogleSignin.signInSilently();
    if (type === 'success') {
      setState({ userInfo: data });
    } else if (result === 'noSavedCredentialFound') {
      // user has not signed in yet
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // handle errror
  }
};
```

---

### `hasPreviousSignIn`

signature: () => `boolean`

This synchronous method may be used to find out whether some user previously signed in.

Note that `hasPreviousSignIn()` can return `true` but `getCurrentUser()` can return `null`, in which case you can call `signInSilently()` to recover the user.
However, it may happen that calling `signInSilently()` rejects with an error (e.g. due to a network issue).

```js
const hasPreviousSignIn = async () => {
  const hasPreviousSignIn = GoogleSignin.hasPreviousSignIn();
  setState({ hasPreviousSignIn });
};
```

---

### `getCurrentUser`

signature: () => [`User`](api#user) \| `null`

This is a synchronous method that returns `null` or `User` object of the currently signed-in user.

```js
const getCurrentUser = async () => {
  const currentUser = GoogleSignin.getCurrentUser();
  setState({ currentUser });
};
```

---

### `clearCachedAccessToken`

signature: (`accessTokenString`: `string`) => `Promise`\<`null`\>

This method only has an effect on Android. You may run into a `401 Unauthorized` error when a token is invalid. Call this method to remove the token from local cache and then call `getTokens()` to get fresh tokens. Calling this method on iOS does nothing and always resolves. This is because on iOS, `getTokens()` always returns valid tokens, refreshing them first if they have expired or are about to expire (see [docs](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/reference/Classes/GIDGoogleUser#-refreshtokensifneededwithcompletion:)).

---

### `getTokens`

signature: () => `Promise`\<[`GetTokensResponse`](api#gettokensresponse)\>

Resolves with an object containing `{ idToken: string, accessToken: string, }` or rejects with an error. Note that using `accessToken` for identity assertion on your backend server is [discouraged](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/migration-guide).

---

### `signOut`

signature: () => `Promise`\<`null`\>

Signs out the current user.

```js
const signOut = async () => {
  try {
    await GoogleSignin.signOut();
    setState({ user: null }); // Remember to remove the user from your app's state as well
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};
```

---

### `revokeAccess`

signature: () => `Promise`\<`null`\>

Removes your application from the user authorized applications. Read more about it [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/disconnect#objective-c) and [here](<https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/auth/api/signin/GoogleSignInClient#revokeAccess()>).

```js
const revokeAccess = async () => {
  try {
    await GoogleSignin.revokeAccess();
    // Google Account disconnected from your app.
    // Perform clean-up actions, such as deleting data associated with the disconnected account.
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};
```

---

### `hasPlayServices`

signature: (`options`: [`HasPlayServicesParams`](api#hasplayservicesparams)) => `Promise`\<`boolean`\>

Checks if device has Google Play Services installed. Always resolves to true on iOS.

Presence of up-to-date Google Play Services is required to show the sign in modal, but it is _not_ required to perform calls to `configure` and `signInSilently`. Therefore, we recommend to call `hasPlayServices` directly before `signIn`.

```js
try {
  await GoogleSignin.hasPlayServices({ showPlayServicesUpdateDialog: true });
  // google services are available
} catch (err) {
  console.error('play services are not available');
}
```

`hasPlayServices` accepts one parameter, an object which contains a single key: `showPlayServicesUpdateDialog` (defaults to `true`). When `showPlayServicesUpdateDialog` is set to true the library will prompt the user to take action to solve the issue, as seen in the figure below.

You may also use this call at any time to find out if Google Play Services are available and react to the result as necessary.
