# Obtaining configuration information

Please note that you **do not** need Firebase to configure Google Sign In. However, if you use it, it's a little easier to set up the sign in experience because Firebase gives you one file to download and put into your project.

## Android

Read below on how to set up Google Sign In for your Android app.

### Obtain SHA-1 certificate fingerprints

:::warning
This is crucial for Google Sign-In to work on Android. If not done correctly, you will get the infamous [`DEVELOPER_ERROR` error](/docs/troubleshooting#developer_error).
:::

You likely have multiple signing configurations - for example for building local debug and release APKs, builds on [Expo EAS](https://docs.expo.dev/app-signing/managed-credentials/#inspecting-credentials-configuration), and [Play App Signing](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9842756?hl=en) for production deployments. You will need to get the SHA1 certificate fingerprints
for _all_ keystores you intend to use and enter them _all_ in Firebase or Google Cloud Console.

  <TabItem value="eas" label="When using Expo EAS">
    If you're using Expo EAS, read [credentials docs](https://docs.expo.dev/app-signing/managed-credentials/#inspecting-credentials-configuration) to learn how to obtain information about how your app is signed with EAS.

<TabItem value="local" label="When developing locally">
  1. From your project root, `cd android && ./gradlew signingReport`.
  2. Scroll to the top of output, see the fingerprints. Debug fingerprint is used in dev,
  release fingerprint is used for release APK.
</TabItem>

  <TabItem value="playStore" label="When releasing via Google Play Store">
    Check if "Google Play App Signing" is enabled for your app [in the console](https://play.google.com/console/u/0/).
    If it is enabled, you need to obtain the "App signing certificate" `SHA-1`.

    You can find it at: App -> Release (in the left sidebar) -> Setup -> App integrity. Under the App signing key certificate, copy `SHA-1 certificate fingerprint`.

### Add SHA-1 to Firebase or Google Cloud Console

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="firebase" label="When using Firebase">
1. Sign in to Firebase and open your project.
2. Click the Settings icon and select Project settings.
3. In the "Your apps" card, select the app you need to add SHA1 to.
4. Click "Add fingerprint".
5. Check that "Package name" is correct.
6. Download the `google-services.json` file.

<TabItem value="cloud-console" label="When not using Firebase">
  Follow the "To create an OAuth 2.0 client ID in the console" instructions
  [here](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en).

## iOS

Read below on how to set up Google Sign In for your iOS app.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="firebase" label="When using Firebase">
1. Sign in to Firebase and open your project.
2. Click the Settings icon and select Project settings.
3. In the "Your apps" card, select the app.
4. Check that "Bundle ID" is correct.
5. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="cloud-console" label="When not using Firebase">

    You need to obtain the `reversed client id`.

    Follow the instructions at ["Get an OAuth client ID"](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start-integrating#get_an_oauth_client_id), ["Get an OAuth server client ID"](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start-integrating#server_client_id) and then ["Configure your application project"](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start-integrating#configure_app_project).

    When done configuring your project (check you selected the correct project in the console), take note of Web Client ID which you may need later. It can be found [here](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).
    The Client IDs are under the OAuth section.
