# WebGoogleSigninButton

This is the sign-in button that you can use in Web apps. It renders `null` when used in native apps.
It has a slightly different API than the native `GoogleSigninButton` component which is why it exists as a separate component.

Web support is only available to sponsors️. [It takes just a few clicks to get access](/docs/install.mdx#accessing-the-private-package-for-sponsors) ❤️.

The button will _not render_ before the [Google Client API has been loaded](../setting-up/web). You can use the `onError` prop to detect this case.

### How to use this

As the One-tap Guide explains, there are two ways to sign in on the Web: using the One-tap UI or using the Google Sign-In button.

One-tap UI may not always be available: This happens if user has [opted out](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/features#globally_opt_out) or when they close the dialog several times in a row, entering the [cooldown period](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/features#exponential_cooldown).

The Google Sign-In button serves as a fallback. Tapping it will open the regular Google Sign-In dialog.

```tsx
import { WebGoogleSigninButton } from '@react-native-google-signin/google-signin';

<WebGoogleSigninButton />;
```
