# One-tap Google sign in

This is the easiest and recommended way to implement Google Sign In. It is a sign in flow that (on Android) requires very little user interaction, thus increasing conversions. This API is available on Android, iOS, macOS and Web (with a little extra work [described below](#web-support)).

- On Android, it is built on top of the [Credential Manager](https://developers.google.com/identity/android-credential-manager).

- On Apple (iOS and macOS), the provided API is a wrapper of the [iOS Google Sign In SDK](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start-integrating), same as the [Original Google Sign In](original). This is so that you can use the same JavaScript API for both Android and Apple.

- On the Web, it covers both the [One-tap](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/offerings#one_tap) flow and the [Google Sign-In button](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/offerings#sign_in_with_google_button).

:::tip
The functionality covered in this page is only available to sponsors️. [It takes just a few clicks to get access](install#accessing-the-private-package-for-sponsors) ❤️.

This module is being actively developed, and new features are added regularly. Since the first release in July 2023, there has been more than 1 release per month on average.
:::

Note that on Apple and Android, you can combine the one-tap methods with those one from the [Original Google Sign In](original). To do that, use the One-tap sign in to sign in the user. Then call `signInSilently()` and then (for example) `getCurrentUser()` to get the current user's information. However, this shouldn't be necessary because this module should cover all your needs. Please open an issue if that's not the case.

```ts title="example of importing the module"
import {
  GoogleOneTapSignIn,
  statusCodes,
  type OneTapUser,
} from '@react-native-google-signin/google-signin';
```

### `configure`

signature: (`params`: [`OneTapConfigureParams`](api#onetapconfigureparams)) => `void`

It is mandatory to call `configure` before attempting to call any of the sign-in methods. This method is synchronous, meaning you can call e.g. `signIn` right after it. Typically, you would call `configure` only once, soon after your app starts.

`webClientId` is a required parameter. Use "autoDetect" for [automatic webClientId detection](#automatic-webclientid-detection). All other parameters are optional.

```ts title="Example of calling the configure() method"
GoogleOneTapSignIn.configure({
  webClientId: 'autoDetect',
});
```

### `checkPlayServices`

✨since v17.3.0

signature: (`showErrorResolutionDialog`?: `boolean`): `Promise`\<[`PlayServicesInfo`](api#playservicesinfo)\>

The behavior of `checkPlayServices` varies across platforms:

- Android: The function resolves if the device has Play Services installed and their version is >= the minimum required version. Otherwise, it rejects with `statusCodes.PLAY_SERVICES_NOT_AVAILABLE` error code, and more information in `userInfo` field (see [below](#example-code-snippet)).

On Android, presence of up-to-date Google Play Services is required to call any of the provided authentication and authorization methods. It is therefore necessary to call `checkPlayServices` any time prior to calling the authentication / authorization methods and only call those if `checkPlayServices` is successful.

The `showErrorResolutionDialog` parameter (default `true`) controls whether a dialog that helps to resolve an error is shown (only in case the error is user-resolvable).

Some errors are user-resolvable (e.g. when Play Services are outdated, or disabled) while other errors cannot be resolved (e.g. when the phone doesn't ship Play Services at all - which is the case with some device vendors).

  <summary>Dialog screenshots</summary>

![prompt enable](/img/prompt-enable.png)

</details>

- Apple: Play Services are an Android-only concept and are not needed on Apple. Hence, the method always resolves with:

```ts
{
  minRequiredVersion: -1,
  installedVersion: -1,
}
```

- Web: resolves (with the same value as on Apple) when the Google Client Library [is loaded](setting-up/web), rejects otherwise.

```ts title="Example of showPlayServicesUpdateDialog() method"
await GoogleOneTapSignIn.showPlayServicesUpdateDialog();
```

### `signIn`

signature: (`params`?: [`OneTapSignInParams`](api#onetapsigninparams)) => `Promise`\<[`OneTapResponse`](api#onetapresponse)\>

| Platform | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Returns a `Promise` that resolves with [`OneTapResponse`](api#onetapresponse) or rejects in case of error.

If there is no user that was previously signed in, the promise resolves with [`NoSavedCredentialFound`](api#nosavedcredentialfound) object. In that case, you can call [`createAccount`](one-tap#createaccount) to start a flow to create a new account. You don't need to call `signIn` as a response to a user action - you can call it when your app starts or when suitable.

### `createAccount`

signature: (`params`?: [`OneTapCreateAccountParams`](api#onetapcreateaccountparams)) => `Promise`\<[`OneTapResponse`](api#onetapresponse)\>

| Platform | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Android  | Starts a flow to sign in with your app for the first time (to create a user account). It offers a list of user accounts to choose from (multiple Google accounts can be logged in on the device).                                                                                            |
| Apple    | Starts an interactive sign-in flow. [Docs](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/reference/Classes/GIDSignIn#-signinwithpresentingviewcontroller:hint:completion:). It offers a list of user accounts to choose from (multiple Google accounts can be logged in on the device). |
| Web      | Presents a one-tap prompt and waits for user interaction (it will not sign in automatically). The prompt has a slightly different styling than with `signIn` (configrable via the `context` param). [Read below](#web-support) for web support.                                              |

You don't need to call `createAccount` as a response to a user action - you can call it some time after your app starts (Though keep in mind the way the dialog is presented on iOS might be inconvenient to users if they didn't ask for it) or when suitable.

Use `createAccount` if `signIn` resolved with [`NoSavedCredentialFound` result](api#nosavedcredentialfound), as indicated in the code snippet above.

Returns a `Promise` that resolves with [`OneTapResponse`](api#onetapresponse) or rejects in case of error.

### `presentExplicitSignIn`

✨since v14.2.0

signature: (`params`?: [`OneTapExplicitSignInParams`](api#onetapexplicitsigninparams)) => `Promise`\<[`OneTapExplicitSignInResponse`](api#onetapexplicitsigninresponse)\>

| Platform | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Android  | Presents the sign in dialog explicitly. This is useful when the user has hit rate limiting ([`ONE_TAP_START_FAILED`](errors#status-codes-specific-to-one-tap-sign-in)) and the one-tap flow is thus not available, or if both `signIn` and `createAccount` resolve with [`NoSavedCredentialFound`](api#nosavedcredentialfound) object - which happens (in the unlikely case) when no Google account is present on the device. This will prompt the user to add a Google account. |
| Apple    | Starts an interactive sign-in flow. Same as `createAccount`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Preferably, call this method only as a reaction to when user taps a "sign in with Google" button.

### `signOut`

signature: (`emailOrUniqueId`: `string`) => `Promise`\<`null`\>

Signs out the current user. On the web, you need to provide the `id` or email of the user. On Android and Apple, this parameter does not have any effect.

Returns a `Promise` that resolves with `null` or rejects in case of error.

```ts
await GoogleOneTapSignIn.signOut(user.id);
```

---

### `requestAuthorization`

✨since v15.0.0

signature: (`params`: [`RequestAuthorizationParams`](api#requestauthorizationparams)) => `Promise`\<[`AuthorizationResponse`](api#authorizationresponse)\>

The underlying Android SDK separates authentication and authorization - that means that on Android you can request an access token and call Google APIs on behalf of the user without previously signing the user in.

This method is used to request extra authorization from the user. Use this on Android to obtain server-side access (offline access) to the user's data or for requesting an access token that has access to additional scopes.

| Platform | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Android  | Presents a modal that asks user for additional access to their Google account. Uses [AuthorizationRequest.Builder](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/auth/api/identity/AuthorizationRequest.Builder). |
| Apple    | Calls [`addScopes`](./original.mdx#addscopes). The resulting `accessToken` has access to the requested scopes. Use this if you want to read more user metadata than just the basic info.                                                   |
| Web      | Not implemented at the moment.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Automatic `webClientId` detection

✨since v15.2.0

This module can automatically detect the `webClientId` from Firebase's configuration file (does not work on Web where you need to provide it explicitly).

This is useful if you're using Firebase and want to avoid manually setting the `webClientId` in your code, especially if you have multiple environments (e.g. staging, production).

To use this feature:

1. Add `WEB_CLIENT_ID` entry to the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.

On Android, the `google-services.json` file already contains the web client ID information. Unfortunately, it's not the case on iOS, so we need to add it ourselves.

Open the `GoogleService-Info.plist` in your favorite text editor and add the following:

```xml
<key>WEB_CLIENT_ID</key>
<string>your-web-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com</string>
```

2. pass `"autoDetect"` as the `webClientId` parameter.

:::tip
On iOS, `iosClientId` can also be detected automatically - simply do not pass any `iosClientId` value.
The reason `webClientId` is a required parameter is API uniformity across all platforms.
:::

---

## Web support

Providing a unified API across all platforms is a bit more tricky than it may seem. The web experience is different from the mobile one, and so are the underlying APIs.

On the web, the `GoogleOneTapSignIn` sign in functions are not `Promise`-based but callback-based as seen below. That means they return `void` and you need to provide callbacks for success and error handling.

Still, the parameter and result types are the same as for native, allowing to reuse the logic for both success and error handling across all platforms.

:::note
The implementation has been migrated to [FedCM](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/fedcm-migration) though you can disable this via `use_fedcm_for_prompt` parameter.
:::

To implement web support, follow these steps:

1. Call `GoogleOneTapSignIn.signIn` upon page load. This attempts to present the One-tap UI. It also sets up a listener for authentication events and calls the `onSuccess` callback when the user signs in (either with the One-tap flow or the Sign-In button).

If you do not want to present the one-tap UI, pass `skipPrompt: true` in the `OneTapSignInParams` object. This only sets up the listener for authentication events, and then relies on the user signing in via the `WebGoogleSigninButton`.

:::warning
You should display the One Tap UI on page load or other window events, instead of it being displayed by a user action (e.g. a button press). Otherwise, you may get a broken UX. Users may not see any UI after a user action, due to [globally opt-out](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/features#globally_opt_out), [cool-down](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/features#exponential_cooldown), or no Google session.

```ts showLineNumbers
useEffect(() => {
  GoogleOneTapSignIn.configure({
    webClientId,
    iosClientId: config.iosClientId,
  });
  if (Platform.OS === 'web') {
    GoogleOneTapSignIn.signIn(
      {
        ux_mode: 'popup',
      },
      {
        onResponse: (response) => {
          if (response.type === 'success') {
            console.log(response.data);
          }
        },
        onError: (error) => {
          // handle error
        },
        momentListener: (moment) => {
          console.log('moment', moment);
        },
      },
    );
  }
}, []);
```

Optionally, you can provide a `momentListener` callback function. The callback is called when important events take place. [See reference.](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/reference/js-reference#PromptMomentNotification)

2. Render the [`WebGoogleSigninButton`](buttons/web.md) component

One-tap UI may not always be available: This happens if you disable it (`skipPrompt`), when user has [opted out](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/features#globally_opt_out) or when they cancel the prompt several times in a row, entering the [cooldown period](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/features#exponential_cooldown).

`WebGoogleSigninButton` serves as a fallback. Tapping it opens the regular Google Sign-In dialog (or redirect, based on `ux_mode` param). When user signs in, the `onResponse` callback is called.

:::info
The reason the `GoogleOneTapSignIn.signIn` api is callback-based rather than promise-based is that it's possible to get into an "error" state (when one-tap is not available) and later get a successful sign in from the button flow. Because of how the Google Sign In for Web SDK is done, modeling this with a promise-based api is not possible.
