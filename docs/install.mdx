‚ö°Ô∏è[**Modern Sign In**](/docs/one-tap) implemented with:

- Android: latest [Credential Manager library](https://developers.google.com/identity/android-credential-manager)
- Web: [Sign In with Google for Web](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/features)
- iOS & macOS: [Google Sign-In SDK](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start)

üñ•Ô∏è **Full platform support** - Deploy everywhere with a unified api: Android, iOS, Web, and macOS

‚úÖ **An example app** - to showcase all **Modern Sign In** features

Your support helps improve the module and upstream SDKs (such as [1](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/pull/788), [2](https://github.com/google/GoogleSignIn-iOS/pull/402)). Thank you for enabling better tools for the community! ‚ù§Ô∏è

### Public version

Available on the public npm registry, this version:

- Has platform support limited to Android and iOS.
- Uses functional, but deprecated [Legacy Android Google Sign-In](https://web.archive.org/web/20240308064911/https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating).
- Contains none of the extra features listed above.

## Obtaining access to the Modern version {#obtaining-access}

[Upon purchasing a license](https://rngs-package.com/auth/login), you will be able to configure your (or your colleagues') access to the private npm package and to the private repo with the sources and examples. Alternatively, as an Expo customer, obtain access through [this form](https://forms.gle/tpP7TfUGW1CwgaEZ8).

[//]: # 'Note that this version is distributed under a [custom license](license).'

Three steps are needed to access the private package, which is hosted on [GitHub npm packages registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry).

1. [Purchase a license](https://rngs-package.com/auth/login) to immediately set up access. Alternatively, [complete the form](https://forms.gle/tpP7TfUGW1CwgaEZ8).

2. [Obtain here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=react-native-google-sign-in&scopes=read:packages) a Personal Access Token with `packages:read` permission.

3. Set up your package manager so that it fetches the package from the GH packages registry instead of the public registry. In this example, we're using an `NPM_TOKEN_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN` environment variable.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs queryString="package-manager">

  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn v3+">
    create a `.yarnrc.yml` file in your project root with the following content:

    ```yml title=".yarnrc.yml"
    npmScopes:
    react-native-google-signin:
    npmRegistryServer: https://npm.pkg.github.com
    npmAuthToken: '${NPM_TOKEN_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN}'
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm / yarn v1">
    create a `.npmrc` file in your project root with the following content:

```txt title=".npmrc"
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN}

@react-native-google-signin:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

If you use another package manager ([such as Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/install/registries)), refer to its documentation on how to set up a custom registry.

## Requirements

The packages support last 3 stable releases of React Native. Unofficially, they may work with older versions too.

If you're using the [New Architecture](https://reactnative.dev/docs/new-architecture-intro), it's strongly recommended to use the latest React Native version available.

## Installing

<Tabs queryString="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @react-native-google-signin/google-signin@latest
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm i @react-native-google-signin/google-signin@latest
    ```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

If you're using the Modern version, open the lockfile (`yarn.lock` / `package-lock.json`...) and verify that the package is fetched from the GitHub registry (the entry must point to `npm.pkg.github.com`, not `registry.npmjs.org`). If it does not, it means that your package manager is not configured correctly - try uninstalling and reinstalling the package.

There are several guides to follow now:

- [Expo guide](setting-up/expo) for native mobile apps built with Expo
- [Web guide](setting-up/web) if you want to use the package on web
- If you're not using Expo but plain React Native, follow [Android guide](setting-up/android) and [iOS guide](setting-up/ios)
