- **Trusted**: Over 130k npm package downloads.
- **See the UI**: [screenshots](screenshots) of the features.
- **Faster Sign-Ups**: Reduce sign-up and sign-in times on Android by up to 50%, according to [Google](https://developer.android.com/identity/sign-in/legacy-gsi-migration#authentication).

Your purchase enables improvements in the module and upstream SDKs (such as [1](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/pull/788), [2](https://github.com/google/GoogleSignIn-iOS/pull/402)).

### Public version

Available on the public npm registry, this version:

- Has platform support limited to Android and iOS.
- Uses functional, but deprecated [legacy Android Google Sign-In](https://web.archive.org/web/20240308064911/https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating).
- Contains none of the extra features listed above.

## Obtaining Universal Sign In {#obtaining-access}

Universal sign in requires [purchasing a license](https://rngs-package.com/#pricing), after which you will be able to configure your (or your colleagues') access to the private npm package and to the private repo with the sources and examples. Alternatively, as an Expo customer, obtain access through this [form](https://forms.gle/tpP7TfUGW1CwgaEZ8).

[//]: # 'Note that this version is distributed under a [custom license](license).'

## Accessing the private npm package {#package-manager-setup}

The private npm package is like any other, but it's hosted on the [GitHub npm packages registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry), not the public npm registry. Therefore, a small bit of setup is needed:

1. [Obtain here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=react-native-google-sign-in&scopes=read:packages) a Personal Access Token with `packages:read` permission.

2. Set up your package manager to fetch the package from the GH packages registry. In this example, we're using an `NPM_TOKEN_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN` environment variable.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs queryString="package-manager">

  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn v3+">
    create a `.yarnrc.yml` file in your project root with the following content:

    ```yml title=".yarnrc.yml"
    npmScopes:
    react-native-google-signin:
    npmRegistryServer: https://npm.pkg.github.com
    npmAuthToken: '${NPM_TOKEN_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN}'
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm / yarn v1">
    create a `.npmrc` file in your project root with the following content:

```txt title=".npmrc"
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN}

@react-native-google-signin:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

If you use another package manager ([such as Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/install/registries)), refer to its documentation setting up a custom registry.

## Installing

<Tabs queryString="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @react-native-google-signin/google-signin@latest
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm i @react-native-google-signin/google-signin@latest
    ```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

If you're using the Universal version, open the lockfile (`yarn.lock` / `package-lock.json`...) and verify that the package is fetched from the GitHub registry (the entry must point to `npm.pkg.github.com`, not `registry.npmjs.org`). If it does not, it means that your package manager is not configured correctly - try uninstalling and reinstalling the package.

There are several guides to follow now:

- [Expo guide](setting-up/expo) for native mobile apps built with Expo
- [Web guide](setting-up/web) if you want to use the package on web
- If you're not using Expo but plain React Native, follow [Android guide](setting-up/android) and [iOS guide](setting-up/ios)

## Requirements

The packages support last 3 stable releases of React Native. Unofficially, they may work with older versions too.

If you're using the [New Architecture](https://reactnative.dev/docs/new-architecture-intro), it's strongly recommended to use the latest React Native version available.
