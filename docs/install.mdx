There are two ways to consume the package:

[//]: # 'üåü'

### Sponsor-Only version

Available to GitHub sponsors, this version includes:

‚ö°Ô∏è[**Modern Sign In**](/docs/one-tap) implemented with:

- Android: latest [Credential Manager library](https://developers.google.com/identity/android-credential-manager)
- Web: [Sign In with Google for Web](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/features)
- iOS & macOS: [Google Sign-In SDK](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start)

üõ°Ô∏è **Advanced [security features](/docs/security)**

üîß **Easier configuration** - [some parameters can be detected automatically](one-tap#automatic-config)

üñ•Ô∏è **Full platform support** - Deploy everywhere with a unified api: Android, iOS, Web, and macOS

Your support helps improve the module and upstream SDKs (such as [1](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/pull/788), [2](https://github.com/google/GoogleSignIn-iOS/pull/402)). Thank you for enabling better tools for the community! ‚ù§Ô∏è

### Public version

Available on the public npm registry, this version:

- Has platform support limited to Android and iOS.
- Uses functional, but deprecated [Legacy Android Google Sign-In](https://web.archive.org/web/20240308064911/https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating).
- Contains none of the sponsor-only features.

## Accessing the private package for sponsors

[Upon sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/vonovak) (use specifically the tiers that mention this project!), you will get an invitation to access the private package and to the private repo with the sources and examples.

Three steps are needed to access the sponsor package, which is hosted on [GitHub npm packages registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry).

1. [Become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/vonovak) and accept the private repository invitation - it takes just a few clicks.

2. [Obtain here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=react-native-google-sign-in&scopes=read:packages) a Personal Access Token with `packages:read` permission.

3. Set up your package manager so that it fetches the package from the GH packages registry instead of the public registry. In this example, we're using an `NPM_TOKEN_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN` environment variable.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="classic" label="npm / yarn v1">
    create a `.npmrc` file in your project root with the following content:

```txt title=".npmrc"
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN}

@react-native-google-signin:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="yarn v3+" label="yarn v3+">
    create a `.yarnrc.yml` file in your project root with the following content:

```yml title=".yarnrc.yml"
npmScopes:
  react-native-google-signin:
    npmRegistryServer: https://npm.pkg.github.com
    npmAuthToken: '${NPM_TOKEN_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN}'
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

If you use another package manager ([such as Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/install/registries)), refer to its documentation on how to set up a custom registry.

## Requirements

The package supports Expo SDK >= 50 / React Native >= 0.73. Unofficially, it may work with older versions, but it's not guaranteed.

If you're using the [New Architecture](https://reactnative.dev/docs/new-architecture-intro), it's strongly recommended to use the latest React Native version available.

## Installing

```bash
yarn add @react-native-google-signin/google-signin@latest
```

If you're a sponsor, open the npm lockfile (`yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`) and verify that the package is fetched from the GitHub registry (the entry must point to `npm.pkg.github.com`, not `registry.npmjs.org`). If it does not, it means that your package manager is not configured correctly.

There are several guides to follow now:

- [Expo guide](setting-up/expo) for native mobile apps built with Expo
- [Web guide](setting-up/web) if you want to use the package on web
- If you're not using Expo but plain React Native, follow [Android guide](setting-up/android) and [iOS guide](setting-up/ios)
