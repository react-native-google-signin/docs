# Installation

There are two ways to consume the package:

### Sponsor-Only Version

Available exclusively to GitHub sponsors, this version offers:

✅ One-tap sign-in support for [Android](https://developers.google.com/identity/android-credential-manager) and [Web](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/features), with an API compatibility layer for iOS and macOS.

✅ [Automatic webClientId detection](one-tap#automatic-webclientid-detection) for Firebase.

✅ Support for macOS (using react-native-macOS).

Your sponsorship enables continued maintenance and development of the module and contributions to upstream SDKs (such as [1](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/pull/788), [2](https://github.com/google/GoogleSignIn-iOS/pull/402)). Thank you for supporting this project! ❤️

### Public Version

Available on the public npm registry, this version does not include One-tap sign-in (it uses the fully functional, but deprecated Google Sign-In for Android), Web and macOS support found in the sponsor-only version.

## Accessing the private package for sponsors

[Upon sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/vonovak) (please use specifically the tiers that mention this project!), you will get an invitation to access the private package and to the private repo with the sources and examples.

Three steps are needed to access the sponsor package, which is hosted on [GitHub npm packages registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry).

1. [Become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/vonovak) and accept the private repository invitation - it takes just a few clicks.

2. [Obtain here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) a Personal Access Token with `packages:read` permission.

3. Set up your package manager so that it fetches the package from the GH packages registry instead of the public registry. In this example, we're using an `NPM_TOKEN_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN` environment variable.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="classic" label="npm / yarn v1">
    create a `.npmrc` file in your project root with the following content:

```txt title=".npmrc"
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN}

@react-native-google-signin:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="yarn v3+" label="yarn v3+">
    create a `.yarnrc.yml` file in your project root with the following content:

```yml title=".yarnrc.yml"
npmScopes:
  react-native-google-signin:
    npmRegistryServer: https://npm.pkg.github.com
    npmAuthToken: '${NPM_TOKEN_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN}'
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

If you use another package manager ([such as bun](https://bun.sh/docs/install/registries)), please refer to its documentation on how to set up a custom registry.

## Requirements

The package requires React Native 0.60 or higher.

If you're using the [New Architecture](https://reactnative.dev/docs/new-architecture-intro), you need to be on React Native 0.72 or higher but it's strongly recommended to use the latest version available.

## Installing

```bash
yarn add @react-native-google-signin/google-signin@latest
```

If you're a sponsor, open the npm lockfile (`yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`) and verify that the package is fetched from the GitHub registry (the entry must point to `npm.pkg.github.com`, not `registry.npmjs.org`). If it does not, it means that your package manager is not configured correctly.

There are several guides to follow now:

- [Expo guide](setting-up/expo) for native mobile apps built with Expo
- [Web guide](setting-up/web) if you want to use the package on the Web
- If you're not using Expo but plain React Native, follow [Android guide](setting-up/android) and [iOS guide](setting-up/ios)
