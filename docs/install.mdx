# Installation

There are two ways to consume the package: [paid](https://universal-sign-in.com) and free. If you are an EAS customer, you may be able to access the paid version for free, [learn more](https://forms.gle/tpP7TfUGW1CwgaEZ8).

Why paid? According to the [State of React Native Survey](https://results.2024.stateofreactnative.com/en-US/opinions/#opinions_pain_points_multiple), unmaintained packages are **the #1 pain point** of the React Native ecosystem. Your purchase enables the module reliability, and contributions to upstream SDKs such as [1](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/pull/788), [2](https://github.com/google/GoogleSignIn-iOS/pull/402), [3](https://github.com/googlesamples/google-services/issues/426).

### Public version (free)

Available on the public npm registry under MIT license, this version:

- Uses the functional, but deprecated [legacy Android Google Sign-In](https://web.archive.org/web/20240308064911/https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating) which may be removed from the Google Play Services Auth SDK (`com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth`) later in 2025 ([source](https://developer.android.com/identity/sign-in/legacy-gsi-migration)). The free package will continue to use a version where the deprecated SDK is present.
- Has platform support limited to Android and iOS.
- Contains none of the extra features listed above.

> If you want to migrate from the public version to the Universal version, follow the [migration guide](migrating#migrating-from-original-to-universal-sign-in).

## Obtaining Universal Sign In {#obtaining-access}

Universal sign in requires [purchasing a license](https://universal-sign-in.com/#pricing), after which you will be able to configure your (or your colleagues') access to the private npm package and to the private repo with the sources and examples.

[//]: # 'Note that this version is distributed under a [custom license](license).'

## Accessing the private npm package {#package-manager-setup}

The private npm package is like any other, but it's hosted on the [GitHub npm packages registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry), not the public npm registry. Therefore, a small bit of setup is needed:

1. [Obtain here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=react-native-google-sign-in&scopes=read:packages) a Personal Access Token with `packages:read` permission.

2. Set up your package manager to fetch the package from the GH packages registry. In this example, we're using an `NPM_TOKEN_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN` environment variable.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs queryString="package-manager">

  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn v3+">
    create a `.yarnrc.yml` file in your project root with the following content:

```yml title=".yarnrc.yml"
npmScopes:
  react-native-google-signin:
    npmRegistryServer: https://npm.pkg.github.com
    npmAuthToken: '${NPM_TOKEN_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN}'
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm / yarn v1">
    create a `.npmrc` file in your project root with the following content:

```txt title=".npmrc"
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN}

@react-native-google-signin:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

If you use another package manager ([such as Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/install/registries)), refer to its documentation for setting up a custom registry.

## Installing

<Tabs queryString="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @react-native-google-signin/google-signin@latest
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm i @react-native-google-signin/google-signin@latest
    ```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

After installing: if you're using the Universal version, open the lockfile (`yarn.lock` / `package-lock.json`...) and verify that the package is fetched from the GitHub registry (the entry must point to `npm.pkg.github.com`, not `registry.npmjs.org`). If it does not, it means that your package manager is not configured correctly - try uninstalling and reinstalling the package.

There are several guides to follow now:

- [Expo guide](setting-up/expo) for native mobile apps built with Expo
- [Web guide](setting-up/web) if you want to use the package on web
- If you're not using Expo but plain React Native, follow [Android guide](setting-up/android) and [iOS guide](setting-up/ios)

## Requirements

The packages support the last 3 stable releases of React Native. Older versions of the packages will work if you run older React Native.

[React Native new architecture](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/landing-page) is supported.
